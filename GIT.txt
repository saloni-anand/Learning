GIT

1. preparation for Git:    git init

2.1 To select a file, use the command   git add file_name
 To record a selected file, run the command  git commit -m "message"

2.2 Using the command   git log, you or anyone else can view the commits.
2.3 To see the changes made, you can use git log -p

With the up and down arrow keys, you can scroll through the changes. 
And to quit just press the Q key.

With git add and git commit, the 2 commands we've already learned, 
you are ready to share files.

Git uses something called a Remote to store shared files.
Developers share files by uploading to and downloading from remotes. 

3. More specifically, to register a remote, type   git remote add remote_name URL

4. We can upload to the remote we made earlier by running:
git push origin master
Uploading like this with Git is called a push.

5.  download the file by running :
git pull origin master
Downloading a file like this is called a pull.

6. Using   git status, you can display a list of modified files.
changed file will be in red
files uploaded will be in green

7. see the content changes: git diff.
changed parts come in green
Modified code will be displayed, as shown on the right, 
with the code after in green and the code before in red.
