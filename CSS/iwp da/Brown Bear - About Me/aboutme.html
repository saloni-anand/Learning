    <h3>Computer Science - Scope</h3>
    <p style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science_and_engineering" target="_blank">Computer Science Engineering</a> (CSE) is an academic program at some universities that integrates the fields of computer engineering and computer science, providing knowledge of computing systems in both hardware and software design. The study program is modeled on German technical universities, where CS, CE and IT are treated as respectively the theoretical, technical and practical part of one field called "Informatik". </p> <p> VIT's main aim is to produce computing graduates with potential, to design and develop systems involving the integration of software and hardware devices, employ innovative approaches in programming and problem solving and solving problems, create Large Scale Software Systems and build data/computing infrastructure for an organization.
      History of computing discipline at VIT dates back to 1993, when the Department of Computer Science & Engineering was established to meet the demand for well-qualified computer professionals. The School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCOPE) was conceived in the year 2009.<br> <br>
      At present, the School headed by <span style="color: maroon; font-weight:bold;">Dr. Saravanan R</span>, has more than 7000 students and 158 core faculty members apart from many visiting professors, distinguished professionals from industry, eminent researchers and teaching/ research assistants.</p>
    <p>Computer science programs lectured on non-technical universities typically centers primarily around theory and software, with only some hardware; upper division courses tend to allow much freedom to specialize in software and theory related areas like:
      <ul>
        <li>algorithms</li>
        <li>artificial intelligence</li>
        <li>cryptography/security</li>
        <li>software engineering</li>
      </ul>
